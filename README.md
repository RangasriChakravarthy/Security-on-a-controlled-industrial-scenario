# Security-on-a-controlled-industrial-scenario
This project was a part of the course CSE235 offered at UCSC

The main goal of this project is to assess simulated industrial environment vulnerabilities of a
cyber-physical system using open-source tools:
● Factory I/O creates a physical simulation of a system and provides sensors and
actuators.
● OpenPLC and OpenPLC editor are used to create, compile and implement control
logic on a Raspberry Pi that acts as a PLC over factory settings.
● Supervisory control and data acquisition SCADA using SCADABR run the
industrial Modbus protocol.
